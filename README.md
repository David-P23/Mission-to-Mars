# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
In this project I created a web app whose purpose is to scrape many websites for data surrounding the "Mission to Mars".  
This app was to then store it in a database with a page that keeps the most up-to-date articles, images, and info.  

The tools used included Conda, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, MongoDB, Splinter, Python, Anaconda Navigator, and BeautifulSoup.
